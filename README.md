# Minesweeper Client

Web app client of minesweeper using [minesweeper-api](https://github.com/eyscode/minesweeper-api). Demo available [online](https://eyscode.github.io/minesweeper-client/).

## Decisions taken

- React was used to build the UI because of its web components orientation.
- Redux was used for state management in the app because of its simplicity and its well know it works great with React.
- Since it's a tiny app, no url routing library was used.
